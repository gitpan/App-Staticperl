Revision history for Perl extension App::Staticperl

1.21  Fri Mar 18 19:21:15 CET 2011
	- ok, irix tar has no working -f and freebsd tar goes to a device
          by default, so screw irix and go with freebsd.
	- some bloke thought it's cool to force dynamic linking on darwin.
          force as in "either you enable it, or the resulting build will be
          forcefully broken". proves that whoever uses darwin deserves it.
          anyway, we now patch away the idiocy in the hints file.
        - for better portability, do not supply -Wl,--no-gc-sections
          -Wl,--allow-multiple-definition, but sitll patch -Wl,--no-gc...
        - new hook: patchconfig.

1.2   Mon Mar 14 00:11:15 CET 2011
        - patch CPAN::HandleConfig as there seems to be no other way to
          keep it from clobbering the users MyConfig.pm accidentally.
        - call cpan internally in a way so it picks up only our MyConfig.pm,
          for extra safety and the initial calls before patching.
        - set default cpan "installer" to EUMM, and MB is too broken
          (it fails to build extensions statically).
	- use "tar x" only to accomodate irix (and possibly other systems).

1.11  Tue Mar  8 18:37:00 CET 2011
	- no longer create bundle variable names from md5(data),
          as it is no longer useful.
        - fix output shortening in testsuite.

1.1   Thu Feb 24 07:20:22 CET 2011
	- use a better -M syntax.
	- the one-arg form of add/binadd was broken.
	- --add and --binadd now use the file as alias if the alias is missing.
	- embeddable bundle files were broken because "args"
          was used before defined.
	- mkapp now actually passes arguments to the boot script.
	- more cpan-testers workarounds :/.
        - implement an ignore-env option for mkbundle.
        - use, not just require, modules when tracing their dependencies.
        - support an optional xs_init argument to staticperl_init, which
          can be 0 (and is then ignored).
        - reduce PERL_ARENA_SIZE to something more reasonable for perl 5.12.
        - use perl 5.12.3 by default.
        - enable debug symbols by default (but not the dreaded -DDEBUGGING).

1.0   Mon Jan 10 15:13:19 CET 2011
        - specify -Uinstallusrbinperl in configure to avoid creating
          /usr/bin/perl.
        - try to work around the totally broken /bin/sh on solaris
          (only in the testsuite).
	- use curl -f instead of just curl.
        - prefer curl over wget again, as cpan seems to do so.
        - clarify license.

0.92  Wed Dec 22 02:09:19 CET 2010
	- major rework of the PHASE 2 documentation section, hopefully
          it's now more clear, more useful, more sexy.
        - renamed --usepacklist to --usepacklists (--usepacklist still
          supported as abbreviation).
	- "properly" get rid of SITELIB paths, avoid using -U compiler flags
          (which didn't even do anything...).
        - avoid export var=value syntax for non-unix shells (solaris...).
        - better output in the error case from the testsuite.

0.912 Wed Dec 15 01:14:26 CET 2010
	- print a longer and hopefully useful message when Configure fails.
	- remove PERL_CPPFLAGS, replace with PERL_CCFLAGS, which get appended
          tot he ccflags, instead of overriding them.
        - introduce PERL_CC.
	- work around *bsd stupidity again, where even root can't replace
          files with mv :/.
        - stop command processing when a command fails (e.g. staticperl mkperl
          will stop if the install step fails).
        - let perl do most configuration when running make test, to increase
          chances of success.

0.911 Sat Dec 11 16:50:41 CET 2010
	- argl, testsuite had a duplicated test.
	- use -Wl,--allow-multiple-definition for better portability.

0.91  Fri Dec 10 22:13:43 CET 2010
	- add testsuite (yeah, should be optional - send patches).
	- started to maintain two demo builds: bigperl and smallperl,
          on http://staticperl.schmorp.de.
	- implemented --staticlib option.
        - special unicore/ compression (but much more could be done,
          especially for the uncompressed case).
        - implemented a strip cache, speeding up ppi stripping enourmously.
        - implemented --include/--exclude options.
        - try to port the tar call to freebsd (reported and analyzed
          by Thomas Linden).
        - (hopefully) better meaning of verbose levels.
        - avoid deadlocking in --eval (unlikely, but possible).
        - implement $STATICPERLRC.
        - do all option AND bundle file processing with Getopt::Long,
          to make maintenance easier.

0.9   Wed Dec  8 23:26:48 CET 2010
	- support AutoLoader'ed functions with prototypes.
        - new mkapp / --app option for mkbundle, to create
          standalone applications.

0.2   Tue Dec  7 21:50:07 CET 2010
        - make it work as non-root user.
        - make module install/linking much more robust against
          build and link failures, i.e. try to only install
          the module when it was actualyl built successfully.
        - split "install" phase into perl install and module
          install, so fixing your postinstall hook takes less time.
        - change make clean to delete the sources dir.
        - add preconfigure hook.

0.1   Tue Dec  7 10:23:43 CET 2010
	- initial release.

0.0   Mon Dec  6 10:44:38 CET 2010
	- cloned from Convert::Scalar.
