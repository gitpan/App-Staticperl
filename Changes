Revision history for Perl extension App::Staticperl

TODO: --ignore-env
TODO: / at glob end == (.pm|/.*)?

1.0   Mon Jan 10 15:13:19 CET 2011
        - specify -Uinstallusrbinperl in configure to avoid creating
          /usr/bin/perl.
        - try to work around the totally broken /bin/sh on solaris
          (only in the testsuite).
	- use curl -f instead of just curl.
        - prefer curl over wget again, as cpan seems to do so.
        - clarify license.

0.92  Wed Dec 22 02:09:19 CET 2010
	- major rework of the PHASE 2 documentation section, hopefully
          it's now more clear, more useful, more sexy.
        - renamed --usepacklist to --usepacklists (--usepacklist still
          supported as abbreviation).
	- "properly" get rid of SITELIB paths, avoid using -U compiler flags
          (which didn't even do anything...).
        - avoid export var=value syntax for non-unix shells (solaris...).
        - better output in the error case from the testsuite.

0.912 Wed Dec 15 01:14:26 CET 2010
	- print a longer and hopefully useful message when Configure fails.
	- remove PERL_CPPFLAGS, replace with PERL_CCFLAGS, which get appended
          tot he ccflags, instead of overriding them.
        - introduce PERL_CC.
	- work around *bsd stupidity again, where even root can't replace
          files with mv :/.
        - stop command processing when a command fails (e.g. staticperl mkperl
          will stop if the install step fails).
        - let perl do most configuration when running make test, to increase
          chances of success.

0.911 Sat Dec 11 16:50:41 CET 2010
	- argl, testsuite had a duplicated test.
	- use -Wl,--allow-multiple-definition for better portability.

0.91  Fri Dec 10 22:13:43 CET 2010
	- add testsuite (yeah, should be optional - send patches).
	- started to maintain two demo builds: bigperl and smallperl,
          on http://staticperl.schmorp.de.
	- implemented --staticlib option.
        - special unicore/ compression (but much more could be done,
          especially for the uncompressed case).
        - implemented a strip cache, speeding up ppi stripping enourmously.
        - implemented --include/--exclude options.
        - try to port the tar call to freebsd (reported and analyzed
          by Thomas Linden).
        - (hopefully) better meaning of verbose levels.
        - avoid deadlocking in --eval (unlikely, but possible).
        - implement $STATICPERLRC.
        - do all option AND bundle file processing with Getopt::Long,
          to make maintenance easier.

0.9   Wed Dec  8 23:26:48 CET 2010
	- support AutoLoader'ed functions with prototypes.
        - new mkapp / --app option for mkbundle, to create
          standalone applications.

0.2   Tue Dec  7 21:50:07 CET 2010
        - make it work as non-root user.
        - make module install/linking much more robust against
          build and link failures, i.e. try to only install
          the module when it was actualyl built successfully.
        - split "install" phase into perl install and module
          install, so fixing your postinstall hook takes less time.
        - change make clean to delete the sources dir.
        - add preconfigure hook.

0.1   Tue Dec  7 10:23:43 CET 2010
	- initial release.

0.0   Mon Dec  6 10:44:38 CET 2010
	- cloned from Convert::Scalar.
